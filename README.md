<h1>Project: Etch-a-Sketch</h1>
<p>My browser version of the popular Etch-A-Sktech toy. This project was done as a part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project's<a> curriculum </p>
<h2>Outcome of the project: </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Improved knowledge of Javascript in general. Especially everything related to <b>event listeners</b> and <b>callback functions</b></li>
    <li>A better understanding of <b>CSS Grid</b> and <b>Flexbox</b></li>
    <li>How to write cleaner and more optimized code. Started from scratch multiple times and with each iteration I managed to clean my code up. It's not perfect but a lot better than my first iteration</li>
    <li>Learned about many new CSS <b>properties</b></li>
</ol>
